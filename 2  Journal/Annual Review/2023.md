### 👓 Annual Reflection

>[!question] What went well this year?

Proud:: I lost quite some weight, started to workout and eat healthier. I started training for a marathon and made very good progress, already able to run 15 km under 90 minutes. I became used to being a father and taking care of our daughter, the connection between my wife and me got stronger and we have a beautiful, happy family life. I got a promotion at work to a team leader position and learned a lot about leadership already. Learned a lot of Italian and already applied it a bit on our vacation in Italy. Started my blog with the LifeOS Series and wrote a few articles already. I learned a lot about personal development, especially goal setting and reflected a lot. Overall I'm happy how this year went and on what I achieved.

>[!question] What did not go well this year?

Improve:: I need to put a higher focus on my health as it is my most valuable resource and I only have one life. Eat healthier, meaning more veggies, less processed food and especially less sugar. Stay consistent with my workout routine. I need to set less goals, but actually focus on them to increase my chance of achieving them all.
