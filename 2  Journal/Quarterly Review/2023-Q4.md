### 👓 Quarterly Reflection

>[!question] What went well this quarter?

Proud:: Continued writing blog posts, it is good, but needs to improve a bit. Went running very often and it is close to becoming a stable habit. Read a lot and also learned a lot from it. Finally got a clearer picture about my to be business.

>[!question] What did not go well this quarter?

Improve:: Need to get up earlier and eat more veggies. Focus could be better, often trying to do too many things at once and then ending up finishing nothing that I planned.
